### Learning Objectives

- Learn how to **analyze service-to-service communication** to evaluate the security risk posed by network-based threats.
- Visualize **notifications** when **malware is executed** within your workloads.
- **Detect and prevent** anomalous behaviors such as attempts to **access restricted URLs**.
- Discover how to **quarantine workloads** to prevent the **lateral movement** of the threat.
- Learn how to build and enforce **security policy** to stop **command and control attack**.

## Workshop Environment Preparation

> :warning: **For this workshop, you are expected to have access to a previously created AKS cluster.**

- Please, follow the instructions on the repository below if you don't have it ready: 

  [Calico Cloud on EKS - Workshop Environment Preparation](https://github.com/tigera-solutions/eks-workshop-prep)

- We will run this workshop from the Azure Cloud Shell, as described in that repository.

- To start your cluster, reload the environment variables create in your Azure Cloud Shell first and then start the cluster. Use the following command:

  ```bash
  source ~/workshopvars.env
  az aks start --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTERNAME
  ```
